# Why I (our team) created this web application
I created this mobile app to show my development skill.

I can create an interactive UI using React Native.

I am able to handle multiple HTTP requests and display the results by understanding of the React component lifecycle and the concept of the component tree.

I have implemented an authentication system of this app by using Json Web Token. I developed an authentication server.(https://github.com/TOMO-YOSHI/Capstone-WebApp)

# System Architecture
![system_archtecture](assets/System_Architecture_diagram-4.png)

## Infrastracture
To deploy the back-end of the app, I am using AWS EC2. I have set up a Node.js web server and MySQL database server on it. Moreover, some other networking settings have been done at the same time, such as reverse proxy, firewall, and SSL.
To automate a deployment process, I have adopted CodePipeline and CodeDeploy, which connect a GitHub repository and EC2.

## Mobile app
In the mobile development, I utilized modern technology, React Native. To manage users' login condition and implement the search functionality, I used Context to manage global states effectively.

## Back-end
Our API server is created by using Node.js and MySQL.

### Authentication and Authorization
I have developed authentication and authorization functionality to implement a login/sign-up function on the front-end. JWT is used to issue tokens, and a token validation is applied to APIs which return confidential information. The authentication server is used for both mobile and web apps.

### S3 storage
S3 storage is used to deliver data. Image and video files stored in the storage are displayed on the UI of the mobile app.
